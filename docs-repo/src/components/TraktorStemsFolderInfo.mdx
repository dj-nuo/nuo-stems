When using ["Native Traktor Pro 4" mode](/docs/getting-started/native-traktor-pro-4), NUO-STEMS 4 saves natively linked STEMS (`{hash}.stem.mp4`) **ONLY** in the folder you have set for Stems in Traktor Pro 4 Preferences.

It's **Traktor Pro 4 requirement to have stems in a specific folder and specific filename format**.
NUO-STEMS 4 follows this requirement to ensure that stems are compatible with Traktor Pro 4.

This also means that no .stem.m4a files are saved to the "output folder" you set in NUO-STEMS 4 Settings.

If you want to **save legacy .stem.m4a files in whatever folder you want**, you can do so by using [Legacy Traktor mode](/docs/getting-started/legacy-traktor).
