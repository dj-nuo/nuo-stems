### I want to generate stems on my Gaming PC and then use them on my DJ Laptop. Can I do this?
Yes, you can use [Legacy / Export Mode](/docs/getting-started/legacy-traktor) to generate .stem.m4a files on your Gaming PC.
Then you can use [Traktor Utilities to migrate .stem.m4a](/docs/traktor-utilities/migrate-stem-m4a-to-tp4) files to linked stems on your DJ Laptop Traktor collection.
Using Traktor Utilities doesn't require paid license.
