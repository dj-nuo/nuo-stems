### "Little Data, Lotta Love" tagging approach

Not particularly related to STEMS, but I think it's a good approach to tagging your tracks and overall organization of your music library.

I use it in combination with iTunes.

{/* My ultimate tagging system, the "Little Data, Lotta Love" approach
==================================================================

Hey guys, cross posting this from [r/DJs](https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/) since some beginners might find it interesting or helpful. Hope you get some inspiration from it.

Every few weeks there is a conversation about "what is the best way to tag your music?" or "how do I build a set?"

One common response is to tell people to sort by genre, key, BPM, and time of night / energy level.

This approach isn't very helpful, especially for DJ's just starting out. I've got an active collection of about 1,600 songs which I've collected over the last 20 years. It's impossible to remember every single track. It's also impossible to plan long sets, and planning sets sucks anyway.

So I developed what I call **"The Little Data, Lotta Love Tagging System"**.

**TL;DR: Tag the heck out of your tracks so you can use search to create instant playlists on the fly.**

**Summary:**

Here is how it work in summary. TAG EVERY TRACK SIX WAYS TO SUNDAY. Most tracks barely use all the variables which MP3 allows you to write. Usually they just include information on the artist, track name, release date, etc.

Instead of just using boring Genre, BPM, rating stars, and so on, use all the other columns that MP3's offer in order to add lots and lots of descriptive information. This could be the vibe, the instruments, the complexity, the intensity, how it makes you feel, the taste it leaves in your mouth, where you heard it first, whatever. The more tags you give it, the more helpful the system becomes.

Once you've tagged your tracks with this level of detail, you can do two amazing things. First, create smart playlists in iTunes, RB, Serato, etc. for any combination of moods, venues, or parties you like. You just create a rule in iTunes and it automatically refreshes the tracks in there. They're always there without having to rebuild the playlist and new tracks get automatically added if they fit.

Second, and this is where the real magic happens, you can instantly create dynamic playlists in real time for any mood or moment just using the search bar. For example, you might remember the feeling of that "banging acid afro track with the sick grinding bass line from about 2 months ago", but you might not be able to remember what the name of it was or who was the artist. No problem! Just type for "banging acid afro track grinding" and sort by date and you've got it! Same for key matching, BPM, etc.

I call this approach "Little Data, Lotta Love" because it lets you DJ with feeling and spontaneity even if you have thousands of tracks and can't remember them all. It's not "big data" because you're not searching millions of variables on millions of tracks. But it still uses a data driven approach which unlocks tons of freedom and creativity. Adding a "little bit of data" as soon as you add the track gives you a "whole lotta love" later when you're performing live.

**More Detail:**

Here is how it works in detail. You should use your own tags and variables (or steal mine), but the process will be the same either way.

When I get a batch of new songs, I first load them into a custom instance of Foobar 2000 (running on Wine on my Mac). Foobar is great because it lets you create your own custom tags with a very efficient workflow. The version I use is adapted from [u/BasCurtiz](https://www.reddit.com/user/BasCurtiz/) (thanks Bas!), who describes how to create a custom workflow here (<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaMbf268BL0>). You can create your own version following his method. But seriously, hats off to [u/BasCurtiz](https://www.reddit.com/user/BasCurtiz/) for bringing such an amazing system into the world. None of this approach would be as easy as it is without his Foobar 2000 scripting work.

Once you set up Foobar to quickly tag a lot tracks, follow these steps:

1.  Tag for overall "Rating". I give all my tracks a 1 star (for interesting but not frequently played), 3 stars (for a good, regular track) or 5 stars (for special, high energy tracks that I love). I used to be more precise with my star rating system, but could never remember the difference between a 3 and a 4 star track, so this is easier for me and works with [u/BasCurtiz](https://www.reddit.com/user/BasCurtiz/)'s default tagging system. This rating gets stored in the track's "star" tag.

2.  Tag for "Genre", which for me doubles as a "set time" indicator for house and techno as well as a more general genre tag. Each track gets tagged as:

-   Start

-   Build

-   Peak

-   Sustain

-   Release

-   Hip Hop

-   Party Breaks

-   Dub / Reaggae

-   Jungle

-   Funk / Disco

This is helpful because although I play deep house most of the time, I also play funk, hip hop, breaks, etc. at different venues or at different times of night. Doubling the tag values like this lets me search by genre in general, or by a specific energy if I'm playing house or techno sets.

3\. Tag by "Mood", which I save in the "Release" tag. This includes:

-   Happy

-   Aggressive

-   Dark

-   Floating / Dreamy

-   Emotional / Introspective

1.  Next, I tag by "Vibes", which goes in the "Comments" tag and is based on the following tags. They might not mean anything to you but the point is to use the tags that you find helpful to describe your music.

-   Acid

-   Afro

-   Arabic

-   Arpeggiated

-   Asian

-   Beats

-   Bouncy

-   Broken

-   Classic

-   Dirty

-   Disco

-   Dope

-   Dreamy

-   Driving

-   Dubby

-   Electro

-   Epic

-   Fun

-   Funky

-   Glitchy

-   Goofy

-   Grindy

-   Head nodding

-   Jazzy

-   Joyful

-   Latin

-   Loopy

-   Melodic

-   Poppy

-   Punchy

-   Sosig

-   Soulful / Musical

-   Spiritual

-   Swung

-   Techy

-   Tropical

-   Weird

This might seem like a lot, but a vibe can apply to all genres and moods of music. You could have a "middle energy, starting, hip hop, happy" track that is also "Glitchy, dirty, broken, and poppy". It will sound totally different than a "high energy, peak time, party breaks, aggressive" track which has those same vibes. Make sure to tag every track with *as many tags as you want to describe it.* This is key, because it unlocks the power of magic searching later on.

Also, these tags might not mean anything to you, so use whatever tags you use to describe your own music in the vocabulary that makes sense to you. It could be "fire, banging, crunchy, etc.", but make the descriptions about the *qualities* of the track, not your *opinion of it*.

5\. Next, tag for what kind of instruments the track features most prominently, including the kind of bass line, the type of vocals, etc. This also gets written into the "Comment" section, appended to the end of the Vibes tags. "Instruments" includes:

-   Hi Hats

-   Horns

-   Piano

-   Organ

-   Strings

-   Congas

-   Sweeps

-   Pads

-   Guitar

-   WalkingBass

-   GrindyBass

-   BoomingBass

-   Spoken Word

-   Chanting

-   Singing

-   Rap

-   Acapella

1.  Finally, save all the changes you've made, throw the tracks in Mixed in Key to analyze the BPM and key of each track, and then import them to your DJ software of choice. I use Traktor but anything will do.

Bonus: Occasionally I might even add a descriptive edit to the title of the track itself to help me remember something more specific, but that is always free form and is just there to jog my memory. Something like "CRAZY PEAK TIME RICHIE HAWTIN VIBE" or anything just as a further descriptive reminder.

**Magic Playlists:"

Once you prep you tracks this way, you become like a Track Management God.

Here's an example of how it use it, with screen shots.

SCREEN SHOTS: <https://imgur.com/0fxso1l>

Lets say you're playing Track A, which is the attached screen shots is "Ngeke (Andhim Remix)". In my system it's tagged as a "Building" track that is "Floating / Spacey" and is "Afro, Arpeggiated, Dirty, Electro" that features "Congas, Sweeps, Pads, and Chanting".

What do you play next? First, I check the tags of the track that is playing (Step 1 in the screen shots).

Since I'm feeling the dirty afro vibe, I type in "afro dirty conga" in Traktor's search bar and get a handful of tracks that are also "building". (Step 2 in the screen shots) Now my options have gone from 1,600 tracks to just 6 tracks that match these tags.

I see a killer Fela Kuti re-edit from Lego that matches those tags, but also is "broken, driving, epic, funky" and more. It's also in the same key and close enough in BPM. I cue it up and give it a listen and hot damn it sounds awesome. Mix it in and you're grooving. (Steps 3 and 4)

Now we're a little into the "funky" and "breakbeat" side of things, so I change my search to "funky, conga, broken" and get a different sub-set of tracks that have similar instruments and vibes. Oh yeah, I forgot about that sick Goldboy track that is really fun and joyful, with a great funk bass line and breakbeat. It's tagged as "Beats, broken, disco, head nodding, jazzy, and soulful", with a slightly different but still similar set of main instruments.

Cue it up and fire!!! It's a perfect mix. I dropped the key down 2 semi tones, which normally would bring the energy level down, but now that I'm in a related but slightly different musical space (with more funky breaks, a walking bass line and a disco loop) it still feels fresh and energetic. The crowd is loving the new direction I'm going, I've got plenty of inspiration, and can work this groove as long as I feel like it, make a slight change, or switch it up entirely if I feel like taking a left turn in a few songs.

**Let the Music Move You:**

I read an interview years ago with the legendary Francois Kevorkian, where someone asked him how he plans his mixes. He said "I don't, I let the music tell me what it wants to be next." We all know that feeling when it just seems like the tracks are picking themselves, you know just how to mix them without even thinking, and the musical energy flows through you in a beautiful feedback loop with the crowd. It's just magic.

If you're like me and have thousands of tracks, there is no way to plan this kind of moment. The "Little Data, Lotta Love" approach helps me do what I do best (read the crowd, feel the music, let the moment flow through the tracks to create a magical night) by using the computer to do what it does best (sort and process lots and lots of information). It's better than a "next song generator" like Smoothie or Next because it's based on *your* feelings and *your* impressions of the tracks, not what someone else played or some algorithm tells you would work. But it uses the best of both worlds to help you create magic moments.

I hope this is useful. Thanks again to [u/BasCurtiz](https://www.reddit.com/user/BasCurtiz/) for helping make this happen with his custom Foobar 2000 scripts that I modified to fit my needs. Now go let the music move you and tell me what you think! */}


{/* Tagging, file organisation, standalone controller use of Little Data, Lotta Love tagging
Hey all.

Few questions regarding music organisation, that I don’t think have been answered elsewhere (apologies if they have and I’ve missed them!)

I’ve read these two great posts on tagging:

https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/s/Qe6U7alKTB

https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/s/QJLrml1G4P

These have some wonderful insight on how to create meaningful tags (especially the Little Data, Lotta Love aka LDLL), so you’re able to categorise, then search your metadata. Thank you to the OPs of each!

So, enough preamble and on to the questions!

Q1. Physical file organisation

How do people physically organise their tracks? I have a whole bunch of tracks as part of bulk downloads, compilations or albums that I wouldn’t play out.

Do people leave their tracks where they are, or do they copy them into a separate DJ folder?

Also; in terms of organising individual tracks, how do people organise those? Folders by top level genre, source (Beatport, Traxsource, etc), or something more complex / clever?

Q2. Workflow - tagging per-track, but en-mass

So, I’m in the midst of trying to organise loads of tracks. And I’m suffering from situational paralysis! I have albums, compilations and individual tracks.

I’d like a tool / combination of tools, where I can use keys to navigate my collection and:

Listen to a track

Add the LDLL tags

Ideally for each section

Ideally as notes alongside the file, rather than altering the ID3v2 tags (or add custom tags which I can keep separate until I decide where to finally house the LDLL data)

I’m tempted to create my own system either using a command line app, or some web-based solution.

Q3. Stand-alone use of Little Data - Lotta Love tags

How does the search work when you have standalone controllers? The searching for the LDLL method seems to indicate a good use of searching, but that will be restricted on standalone controllers, won’t it? For reference I’ve just bought a pair of 2nd hand Denon SC5000’s

(Edited from cream my own system to create) */}
