### What if I have duplicate tracks and use "Native Traktor Pro 4" mode?

This applies only to [Traktor Pro 4 native mode](/docs/getting-started/native-traktor-pro-4).

:::warning Traktor Limitation: Duplicate Tracks

Traktor searches for linked stems files by **AUDIO_ID** of the original track. This means that if you have duplicate tracks (same original) in your collection, they will share the same linked stems file (`{hash}.stem.mp4`).

**Important:** If you process stems for one duplicate track using Traktor's built-in stem separation, it will overwrite the NUO-STEMS processing for all other duplicate tracks of the same original.

**To avoid this issue:**
- Remove duplicate tracks from your collection. (**recommended**)
- Use NUO-STEMS 4 exclusively for stem processing when you have duplicate tracks

This is a Traktor limitation, not a NUO-STEMS 4 limitation.

---
Here is what an example of this issue looks like:
- Generate Stems for Track A in NUO-STEMS 4 in ["Native Traktor Pro 4" mode](/docs/getting-started/native-traktor-pro-4)
- Go to Traktor and add another duplicate of the track 
  - Now you have Track A (already processed by NUO-STEMS 4) and Track B (duplicate of Track A, not processed, doesn't have linked stems)
- Click "Generate Stems" for Track B in Traktor Pro 4
- The NUO-STEMS 4 processing of Track A gets overwritten (both tracks now use Traktor's stem separation)
