{/* ### I use only Traktor Pro 3, can I still use NUO-STEMS 4? */}
### Traktor Pro 3 compatibility
:::danger Traktor Pro 3 Limitation
.stem.m4a files created in NUO-STEMS 4 are not compatible with Traktor Pro 3.
:::

When trying to load .stem.m4a files created in NUO-STEMS 4 in Traktor Pro 3, you will see an error:
> `Can not read stem metadata for file: FILE.stem.m4a. Detail: version: 2 is not supported`.

This is a deliberate decision for NUO-STEMS 4 to not support Traktor Pro 3 - I want you to support Traktor team by upgrading to Traktor Pro 4. I strongly believe that 50$ (as of Black Friday deals) is a great value for what you're getting - it's an investment into future of Traktor.

Traktor Pro 3 was released October 18, 2018. Which is more than 7 years ago.

:::info How to use .stem.m4a in Traktor Pro 3?
If you need to use .stem.m4a in Traktor Pro 3, you can continue to use [NUO-STEMS 3](/docs/v3/) with Traktor Pro 3.

You can read more about this in [Legacy / Export Mode](/docs/getting-started/legacy-traktor) section.
