### Can I use my license on 2 computers?
One license is only for one computer.

If you want to transfer your license to another computer – see [License Transfer](/docs/license-transfer) page 🙂

If you want to use Gaming PC to generate stems and then use them on your DJ Laptop - you only need 1 license:
- Gaming PC - **needs license**
- DJ Laptop - **doesn't** need license

See [using another computer to generate stems](/docs/tips-and-workflows/gaming-pc-to-dj-laptop) for more information.
