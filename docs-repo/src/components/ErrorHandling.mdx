### Dealing with Errors in NUO-STEMS 4

Errors happen. If your track fails to process, you can see the exact error message by hovering over the error icon next to the track in the queue.

It's usually enough to understand the error and fix it on your own.

Sometimes, error may simply go away if you just re-add the track to the queue.
