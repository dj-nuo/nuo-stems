### Can NUO-STEMS replace Stem Creator by Native Instruments?
First of all, here is the fix to Stem Creator to make it work with latest versions of MacOS: [link](https://community.native-instruments.com/discussion/2946/stem-creator-m1-monterey-export-failed/p2)

Secondly, here is the reason why "not":\
Mostly because of "compressor" & "limiter" that are present in Stem Creator. It looks like some VST magic that NI built into Stem Creator to provide real-time feedback. I'm not familiar with this technology, so your best luck remains with Stem Creator 🙂

### NUO-STEMS is "stuck" at "Checking License" or "License Check Failed"
:::warning
**First, check that you can open https://nuo-stems.com in your browser.**
If you can't - there might be a problem with your internet connection or DNS settings.
:::

There might be few potential causes:

1.  Your computer is not connected to the internet. NUO-STEMS requires internet connection on the startup to check the license.
2.  Your provider/system/WiFi-router blocks `https://nuo-stems.com` from being reachable.
    1.  Restart computer
    2.  **Restart WiFi router**
    3.  Launch NUO-STEMS
3.  Windows PowerShell is for some reason "broken" on your computer
    1.  Follow this guide to fix it: [link](https://support.slatedigital.com/hc/en-us/articles/20352080857363-Powershell-is-not-recognized)

If none of the above helps - try settings your DNS to Cloudflare DNS: 1.1.1.1 and 1.0.0.1. Instructions: [link](https://one.one.one.one/help/)

###  NUO-STEMS crashes at launch
Try deleting these folders and then start NUO-STEMS again:

1. On Windows:
    1. `C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\AppData\Local\Programs\NUO-STEMS-4\` 
        - (or `NUO-STEMS-3` if you're using NUO-STEMS 3)
    2. And also remove: `C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\NUO-STEMS-4\` 
        - (or `NUO-STEMS-3` if you're using NUO-STEMS 3)
2. On Mac OS:
    1. `/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Library/Application Support/nuo-stems-4/` 
        - (or `nuo-stems-3` if you're using NUO-STEMS 3)

If it doesn't help:

1. Launch NUO-STEMS and let it "crash"
2. [Send me](https://www.facebook.com/djnuo) main.log file from:
    1. Windows logs location: `C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\nuo-stems-4\logs\main.log` 
        - (or `nuo-stems-3` if you're using NUO-STEMS 3)
    2. Mac OS logs location: `/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Library/Logs/nuo-stems-4/main.log`

###  [error] Unhandled Exception UnhandledRejection Error: Python exited with code 255
Solution: change Preferred Algorithm in “Settings” from MPS to CPU.

### Can I use my license on 2 computers?
One license is only for one computer.

If you want to transfer your license to another computer – see [License Transfer](/docs/license-transfer) page 🙂

If you want to use Gaming PC to generate stems and then use them on your DJ Laptop - you only need 1 license:
- Gaming PC - **needs license**
- DJ Laptop - **doesn't** need license

See [using another computer to generate stems](/docs/tips-and-workflows/gaming-pc-to-dj-laptop) for more information.

### My collection.nml got corrupted, how do I fix it?
NUO-STEMS 4 (and NUO-STEMS 3) automatically creates a backup of your collection.nml on every launch. If you have a problem with your collection.nml - try to revert it to the backup.

Backups are stored in the **"Collection Backups NUO-STEMS 4"** or **"Collection Backups NUO-STEMS 3"** folder in the same folder as your collection.nml. Example for Traktor 4.1.1:
- MacOS: `/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Documents/Native Instruments/Traktor 4.1.1/Collection Backups NUO-STEMS 4` or `3`
- Windows: `C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\Documents\Native Instruments\Traktor 4.1.1\Collection Backups NUO-STEMS 4` or `3`
