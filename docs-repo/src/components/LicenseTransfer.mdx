### I bought new computer, how do I activate/transfer my license to it?
If you want to transfer license to new computer - you need to [send me ONLY VIA EMAIL](/docs/contact-support):

1.  **Use email that you used for purchase** (I will not accept license transfer via any other email)
    1. Upon purchase, you always receive an email from support@2checkout.com, so try searching for it in your email inbox.
2.  **New computer uuid:**
    1. Go to NUO-STEMS 4 "Settings" -> "Activation & License" -> Copy computer UUID
