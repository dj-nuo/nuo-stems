NUO-STEMS 3.1.1-alpha.8 updates. Let me know if it works for you.

<!-- truncate -->

- Traktor Utilities: now matching of original ↔️ STEMS version is done also by audio information (previously matching was only by the filename)
- Traktor Utilities: fixed a bug where even identified pairs sometimes didn’t sync
- Traktor Utilities: button is now called “Sync All” to prevent confusion with tickboxes
- Traktor Utilities: fixed bug where some pair didn’t sync due to non-latin characters
- Quality of life: NUO-STEMS on MacOS now supports differential updates. It means that you won’t need to download whole 2.5 GB every time there is an update. Instead, it will download only what was changed (e.g. 100 MB)
