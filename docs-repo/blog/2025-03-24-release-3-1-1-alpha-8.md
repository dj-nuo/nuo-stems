- Traktor Utilities: fixed bug where some pair didn’t sync due to non-latin characters
- Quality of life: NUO-STEMS on MacOS now supports differential updates. It means that you won’t need to download whole 2.5 GB every time there is an update. Instead, it will download only what was changed (e.g. 100 MB)
