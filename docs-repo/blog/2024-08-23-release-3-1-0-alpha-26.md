## 3.1.0-alpha.26 - 23 August 2024

### Updates:

- completely reworked under-the-hood to potentially provide more stable performance for "mel_band_roformer" & other algorithms. You might also experience higher benchmark on systems with good NVidia GPU or Apple Silicon
- added new preset for STEMS Colors - "Traktor Pro 4" color preset
- removed "STEMS Metadata" section from Settings
- removed "mdx_extra" algorithm, as mentioned in previous post (it's outdated & almost nobody uses it)
