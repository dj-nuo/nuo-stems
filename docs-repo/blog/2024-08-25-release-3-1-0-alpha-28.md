## 3.1.0-alpha.28 - 25 August 2024

### Updates:

- New "Sum of stems = original mix" feature. Makes sum of stems (drums, bass, other, vocals) exactly equal original mix. Keep in mind that this will make the stem that you selected very "dirty".
- New "Added silence duration feature". 100ms of additional silence was introduced in early versions of 3.1.0-alpha. Now there is an option to enable/disable adding 100ms of silence to the beginning of the track.
- Saving .wav stems now has additional option - "Template of the filename". You can now select whether you want to append/prepend original filename to each individual stem, or leave it without it. (example: filename_vocals.wav)
