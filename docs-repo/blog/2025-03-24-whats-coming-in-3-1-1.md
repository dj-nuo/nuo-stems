Iâ€™m working on the next update of NUO-STEMS.
In the nearest days you will see 3.1.1-alpha releases coming out.

<!-- truncate -->

I advice you NOT TO INSTALL those, because they will be experimental & will most certainly break.
Please wait until further notice.

Planned updates:

- Traktor Utilities. Itâ€™s UX is not great & I want to find a way to fix it. If you have ideas â€“ let me know in the comments ðŸ™‚
- Traktor Utilities. Matching tracks by audio information (not just filename)
- Error handling. I want to implement more obvious information on what went wrong for the user without the need to send me log files. This also includes implementing an option to continue processing tracks if one fails.
- Potential memory usage improvements to STEMS Conversion process (I expect ~500-900 MB less usage than now).
