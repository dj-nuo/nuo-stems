## 3.1.0-alpha.33+32 - 11 September 2024

### Updates:

- New AAC Encoder on Windows -- QAAC (instead of FFMPEG aac). On Windows, NUO-STEMS is now using QAAC as AAC encoder. In simple terms: 256 AAC compression of stems shall be significantly improved resulting in higher quality. QAAC provides results that are almost identical to Mac AAC encoding.
- NEW Feature: "AI distribute on 'drums' and 'other' stem" -- when using "sum of stems = original", new option is now selected by default.
  - It substantially cleans up "other" stem from leftovers of drums & percussion, while keeping "sum of stems = original"

### Fixes:

- fixed issue of not being able to convert using htdemucs & htdemucs_ft algorithms (resulting is "-1%")
