Now launches 20x faster & more.

<!-- truncate -->

- HIGHLY improved **loading times**. Previously program took 1-5 min to launch, now - it launches in &lt;10 sec
- Added **Mac OS 10.12, 10.13** support! NUO-STEMS now supports all Mac OS systems from 10.12+, including **Big Sur**.
- **Updated core** from Tensorflow v1 to Tensorflow v2 - which yields more stable and faster processing results
- Traktor Utilities now also transfers **Title**, **Artist**, **Album** and **Genre** metadata from originals to .stem versions. This is useful when .wav files don't have metadata embedded
- AI Models are now embedded into the program, so they don't need to be downloaded separately
