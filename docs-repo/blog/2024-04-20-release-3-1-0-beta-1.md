## 3.1.0-beta.1 - 20 April 2024

Download this version if you want to participate in beta test. All communication on beta-testing is happening on FB group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/nuostems

### Traktor Utilities:

- Improvements:
  - Much improved precision when transferring hotcues & beatgrids. Missed ratio on my 2300 tracks collection is 1.70 %.
  - Much increased speed of transfer
- Fixes:
  - STEMS colors are now changed for all STEMS in the collection. Previously it was only for "matched pairs"
- Features:
  - Ability to set "manual offset" in milliseconds between original & STEMS version. Useful when Traktor Utilities calculates offset wrong. Available in Traktor Utilities -> Transfer section -> See all matched tracks
  - Now NUO-STEMS checks if Traktor Pro is opened & warns the user to close Traktor before doing the transfer

### Convert page:

- All newly-converted STEMS now have additional 100ms of silence at the beginning of the track. This is needed for properly transfer of Hotcues & Beatgrids in Traktor Utilities

### Settings:

- Update Channel. You can now select which version of NUO-STEMS you want to use & keep up to date. Available options: default, stable, beta, alpha. Useful when you want to try some of the cutting edge features.
