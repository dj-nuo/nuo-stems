10x better quality (Demucs v3), STEMS color, new design & logo.

- 10x better quality of separation thanks to new algorithm – **Facebook Demucs v3**. It now takes much longer to separate STEMS but gives incredible results
- New Feature: “**STEMS color**”. You can now change individual stem (e.g. drums) colours for all STEM files in your collection. This is especially useful when using Traktor S4 mk3 with color pads.
- Default color of all 4 stems is now set to violet/purple.
- New design & logo
