## 3.1.0-alpha.31 - 4 September 2024

### Updates:

- Fixed a bug where conversion got stuck on "-1 %" if lyrics of the track contained special symbols.
- 3.1.0-alpha.31 -- **VERY IMPORTANT UPDATE**.

  TLDR: You need to re-convert your STEMS if you used mel_band_roformer before.

  So, I discovered a bug that quality was not improved prior to this release, and it stayed the same as 3.0.0 for drums, bass & other.

  What it means (I'm comparing PRE-3.1.0-alpha.30 and 3.1.0-alpha.31):

  SDR (quality metric - check this video for explanation: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxphQmFIlk0&pp=ygUJbnVvIHN0ZW1z) ):

  - Drums: improved: 11.26 > 11.77
  - Bass: improved: 12.04 > 12.38 (you can actually hear that there are now very little drums leaks)
  - Other: improved: 5.74 > 6.90 (also, drums leaks are now minimal. Another bonus: of you enable "sum of stems = original", it now goes into "other" stem quite well)
  - Vocals: 10.85. (nothing changed here since release of mel_band_roformer)

  What it all means, is that quality improved substantially in different areas, and if you used "mel_band_roformer" algorithm to convert to STEMS since it's release, you now need to re-convert all your tracks to actually gain quality increases in all stems, and not just vocal
