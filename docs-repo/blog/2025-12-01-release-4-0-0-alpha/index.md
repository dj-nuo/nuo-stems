Release the kraken! NUO-STEMS 4-alpha is now fully integrated with Traktor Pro 4.

Yes, linked native STEMS! 🔥

Edit: now available on Windows, Apple Silicon & MacOS Intel.

Months of hard work, millions of burned LLM tokens, sleepless nights and battle-testing in actual gigs.
Now you don’t need to have 2 separate entries in your collection for original and .stem.m4a.
STEMS are stored & displayed in Traktor Pro 4 as “native, linked STEMS”.

NUO-STEMS 4 works only with Traktor Pro 4. This is a deliberate decision - I want you to support Traktor team by upgrading to Traktor Pro 4. I strongly believe that 50$ (as of Black Friday deals) is a great value for what you’re getting - it’s an investment into future of Traktor.

You can still generate .stem.m4a files for Traktor Pro 3, but there are no “Traktor Utilities” to transfer metadata between originals and .stem.m4a. This also means that you can omit having originals altogether, and just use .stem.m4a in TP4 to save disk space.

Grid offset also seems improved even more (100% accuracy on my collection).

Also, as promised, all the users who purchased NUO-STEMS 3 after the date of 1 November 2025 will automatically be upgraded to NUO-STEMS 4.

My next step is to make everything work on 🔥Windows🔥, so stay tuned for that announcement.
