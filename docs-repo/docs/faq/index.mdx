### Why NUO-STEMS 4 generates weird `{hash}.stem.mp4` files?
> *I converted my track to stems using "Traktor Pro 4" tab in NUO-STEMS 4 and got this file:*
`...Traktor/Stems/069/F0ILIYDQZQLICDIKTDVCBPX0XLPC.stem.mp4`

You may have questions like:
- Why is it named like this? 
- Why is it not saved to the ["output folder"](/docs/settings/general#output-folder) I set in NUO-STEMS 4 Settings?
- How to fix it?
- I want to have custom folder for stems, not in Traktor/Stems/069/ folder.

### I generate stems in Native Traktor Pro 4 mode, but they don't appear as linked in my collection?
Usually, the only reason this happens is if you don't have correct collection.nml selected.

Make sure to select the correct collection.nml file.

### For existing TP4 stems, will NUO-STEMS 4 replace these in-place?
Yes, just right-click on track/s in ["Traktor Pro 4" tab](/docs/getting-started/native-traktor-pro-4) of NUO-STEMS 4 and click "Add to Queue".

### New native mode will also mean the playlists are now automatically synced from the original to the stem?
Yes. Playlists consist of original tracks. And original tracks have natively linked stems.

### If I'm using 320 AAC CBR stems, is it still better to process using FLAC files vs high quality MP3? I keep most of my music in mp3 (but I convert them from FLAC myself using high quality conversion)
Depends on your "lossless religion" 😅. I'd say mp3 is fine. I just keep my library original all ALAC, as it's easier to download them this way. 
And in case future algorithms will need lossless for some reason - I'm covered.
But of course, I have random mp3 and m4a tracks from SoundCloud that are completely lossy.

Another argument for FLAC/ALAC originals is how mp3 gets decoded into WAV/FLAC/ALAC. If you've ever heard about [hotcue offset issues when converting hotcues between Traktor/RB/Serato/etc](https://pestrela.github.io/dj_kb/dj_collection_converters/#what-is-the-26ms-shift-issue-when-converting-cuesloops-between-softwares) - this is what it's related to - mp3 decoding which impacts absolute track duration.

If you're using "natively linked" 320 CBR NUO-STEMS 4 stems though, it relies on what's inside your collection (in your case - .mp3 originals). So if you're not using FLAC/ALAC in your collection - you won't be able to convert from FLAC/ALAC to "natively linked" STEMS as well (due to the mp3 decoding issues described above).

### My Anti-Virus complaints about NUO-STEMS 4 on Windows
If you're using Windows, your Anti-Virus might complain about NUO-STEMS 4. 

This is because NUO-STEMS is not "signed" on Windows because it's incredibly hard to obtain "EV Certificate". You need to have a company, various checks etc. At some point I tried to do that, but failed due to being situated in Ukraine. There are no such issues on MacOS - everything is properly signed there.

### I don't have originals in my collection, I only use .stem.m4a files. Can I still use NUO-STEMS 4?
See [I have only .stem.m4a and no originals](/docs/tips-and-workflows/only-stem-m4a-no-originals) for more information.
