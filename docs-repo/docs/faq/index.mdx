### Why NUO-STEMS 4 generates weird `{hash}.stem.mp4` files?
> *I converted my track to stems using "Traktor Pro 4" tab in NUO-STEMS 4 and got this file:*
`...Traktor/Stems/069/F0ILIYDQZQLICDIKTDVCBPX0XLPC.stem.mp4`

You may have questions like:
- Why is it named like this? 
- Why is it not saved to the ["output folder"](/docs/settings/general#output-folder) I set in NUO-STEMS 4 Settings?
- How to fix it?
- I want to have custom folder for stems, not in Traktor/Stems/069/ folder.

### For existing TP4 stems, will NUO-STEMS 4 replace these in-place?
Yes, just right-click on track/s in ["Traktor Pro 4" tab](/docs/getting-started/native-traktor-pro-4) of NUO-STEMS 4 and click "Add to Queue".


### New native mode will also mean the playlists are now automatically synced from the original to the stem?

### I use only Traktor Pro 3, can I still use NUO-STEMS 4?
Yes, you can use NUO-STEMS 4 with Traktor Pro 3 by generating .stem.m4a files (aka "legacy" stems).
BUT, there are no ["Traktor Utilities"](/docs/v3/traktor-utilities/general/) similar to NUO-STEMS 3 which would allow you to transfer metadata between originals and stems.
Essentially, you need to treat .stem.m4a files as [first class citizens](/docs/tips-and-workflows/only-stem-m4a-no-originals) - and get rid of original files (e.g. MP3/WAV/etc).

This is a deliberate decision - I want you to support Traktor team by upgrading to Traktor Pro 4. I strongly believe that 50$ (as of Black Friday deals) is a great value for what you’re getting - it’s an investment into future of Traktor.

You can read more about this in [Legacy / Export Mode](/docs/getting-started/legacy-traktor) section.

### If I'm using 320 AAC CBR stems, is it still better to process using FLAC files vs high quality MP3? I keep most of my music in mp3 (but I convert them from FLAC myself using high quality conversion)
Depends on your "lossless religion" 😅. I'd say mp3 is fine. I just keep my library original all ALAC, as it's easier to download them this way. 
And in case future algorithms will need lossless for some reason - I'm covered.
But of course, I have random mp3 and m4a tracks from SoundCloud that are completely lossy.

Another argument for FLAC/ALAC originals is how mp3 gets decoded into WAV/FLAC/ALAC. If you've ever heard about [hotcue offset issues when converting hotcues between Traktor/RB/Serato/etc](https://pestrela.github.io/dj_kb/dj_collection_converters/#what-is-the-26ms-shift-issue-when-converting-cuesloops-between-softwares) - this is what it's related to - mp3 decoding which impacts absolute track duration.

If you're using "natively linked" 320 CBR NUO-STEMS 4 stems though, it relies on what's inside your collection (in your case - .mp3 originals). So if you're not using FLAC/ALAC in your collection - you won't be able to convert from FLAC/ALAC to "natively linked" STEMS as well (due to the mp3 decoding issues described above).

### My Anti-Virus complaints about NUO-STEMS 4 on Windows
If you're using Windows, your Anti-Virus might complain about NUO-STEMS 4. 

This is because NUO-STEMS is not "signed" on Windows because it's incredibly hard to obtain "EV Certificate". You need to have a company, various checks etc. At some point I tried to do that, but failed due to being situated in Ukraine. There are no such issues on MacOS - everything is properly signed there.

### I don't have originals in my collection, I only use .stem.m4a files. Can I still use NUO-STEMS 4?
See [I have only .stem.m4a and no originals](/docs/tips-and-workflows/only-stem-m4a-no-originals) for more information.
