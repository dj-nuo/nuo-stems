This utility allows you to extract individual stems from .stem.m4a/.stem.mp4 containers.

Useful when you want to extract stems from .stem.m4a/.stem.mp4 files to use them in non-Traktor DJ software (Rekordbox, Serato, etc.) or in DAWs (Ableton Live, Logic Pro, etc.).

:::tip
Extracting stems from .stem.m4a/.stem.mp4 files is quicker than re-generating them using NUO-STEMS 4.

But it also means that quality of the stems will be lower than if you re-generate them using NUO-STEMS 4 and save results as [.wav files](/docs/getting-started/daw-non-traktor), because .stem.m4a/.stem.mp4 files are usually encoded as AAC (defined in setings). You can change this in NUO-STEMS 4 Settings to use ALAC encoding, but it has its own drawbacks.

## Overview

When you extract WAV files from .stem.m4a:
- Individual stem files are extracted as separate WAV files
- Each stem (vocals, drums, bass, other, master) is saved as its own WAV file
- Files are saved to your specified output folder
- Original .stem.m4a files remain unchanged

## Multi-track playback
Just as a handy feature, you can play back the stems as multi-track audio. With ability to solo/mute individual stems.
