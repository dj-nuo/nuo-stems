title: Change STEMS colors for previously converted native stems

This utility allows you to update the colors of individual STEMS parts (drums, bass, other, vocals) for [natively linked STEMS](/docs/getting-started/native-traktor-pro-4) that were previously converted.

:::info
**Note**: Colors set in [Settings](/docs/settings/traktor-pro#stems-colors) only apply to newly converted files. Use this utility to update colors for files that were already converted.
