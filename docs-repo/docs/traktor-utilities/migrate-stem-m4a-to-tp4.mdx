# Migrate .stem.m4a (created in NUO-STEMS 4) to natively linked TP4 stems


Used with [Legacy / Export Mode](/docs/getting-started/legacy-traktor) to migrate .stem.m4a files generated on your Gaming PC to linked stems on your DJ Laptop Traktor collection.

:::warning
If your originals are in AAC/ALAC format, make sure both you Gaming PC and DJ Laptop are using the same platform (Windows/MacOS). Otherwise, you might experience issues with the migration process, as Traktor Pro 4 decodes AAC/ALAC differently on different platforms resulting in different track lengths and different AUDIO_ID's.

This is a [known Traktor issue](https://community.native-instruments.com/discussion/comment/250963) and NUO-STEMS 4 does not fix it.

If you're using FLAC/MP3/AIFF/etc originals, you're safe to use this utility on any platform.

:::tip
This is a free feature in NUO-STEMS 4. No license required.

## Typical workflow
1. Generate `.stem.m4a` files on your Gaming PC using [Legacy / Export Mode](/docs/getting-started/legacy-traktor)
2. Copy `.stem.m4a` files to your DJ Laptop
3. Open NUO-STEMS 4 on your DJ Laptop
4. Navigate to the **Traktor Utilities** tab - "Migrate `.stem.m4a` (created in NUO-STEMS 4) to natively linked TP4 stems"

5. Select the folder with `.stem.m4a` files you want to migrate

6. Click "Migrate All". Alternatively, you can click "Migrate" on individual `.stem.m4a` files to migrate only selected `.stem.m4a` files.

:::tip 
I recommend trying migrating just one `.stem.m4a` file first to make sure that the migration process is working correctly.
If it's working correctly, you can then migrate all `.stem.m4a` files in the folder.

7. Wait for the migration process to complete
8. STEMS shall now be available in your Traktor collection as natively linked STEMS.

9. Enjoy your stems!

## Technical details
- Utility tries to match original in collection with your `.stem.m4a` files by their file names without extension (e.g. `song.mp3` -> `song`).
- If you have multiple original tracks or `.stem.m4a` files with the same file name, utility will use music fingerprint to match them.
- Only `.stem.m4a` files created in NUO-STEMS 4 are supported. This is because NUO-STEMS 4 uses a different decoding mechanism than NUO-STEMS 3.
- `.stem.m4a` files are copied as .stem.mp4 files to the Stems Folder specified in Traktor Pro 4 Preferences.
