## Preferred Algorithm

See available algorithms in [Stems Separation Quality](/docs/stems-separation-quality) section.

## Sum of Stems = Original Mix

This option makes the sum of stems (drums, bass, other, vocals) exactly equal to the original mix.

**Options:**
- **AI Method** - Uses AI to distribute the difference across drums and other stems
- **Disabled** - Stems are kept as clean as possible without ensuring the sum equals the original

:::info
**For DJing**: Keep this option enabled (AI Method) to ensure the sum of stems equals the original mix.

**For Music Production**: It's recommended to disable this option to get cleaner individual stems.

Due to the nature of audio separation algorithms, the output stems want to be as clean as possible, but this also means a small portion of audio information is lost. To mitigate this, NUO-STEMS calculates what audio information was lost and provides an option where the sum of individual stems equals the original audio mix.

## Output Folder

Select the folder where processed files will be saved.

:::warning
This setting only works in [Legacy mode](/docs/getting-started/legacy-traktor).

<TraktorStemsFolderInfo />

## Output to Original Folder

When enabled, conversion results are saved to the same location as the original track.

:::warning
This setting only works in [Legacy mode](/docs/getting-started/legacy-traktor) or ["DAW / Non-Traktor" mode](/docs/getting-started/daw-non-traktor).

In ["DAW / Non-Traktor" mode](/docs/getting-started/native-traktor-pro-4), the output folder is only used for:
- .wav files
- Instrumental and acapella files

In [Legacy mode](/docs/getting-started/legacy-traktor), the output folder is ALSO used for:
- .stem.m4a files

## Keep WAV Files

When enabled, the original WAV files (drums, bass, other, vocals, instrumental) will be saved in the output folder alongside the processed stems.

### WAV Filename Template

When "Keep WAV files" is enabled, you can select the template for stem filenames:

- **Basic** - Just keeps the stem name. Example: `vocals.wav`
- **Prepend** - Adds original filename before stem name. Example: `filename_vocals.wav`
- **Append** - Adds original filename after stem name. Example: `vocals_filename.wav`

### Append Metadata to WAV Filenames

When enabled, conversion metadata (algorithm, sum of stems = original, app version) will be appended to WAV filenames.

Example:
`track1_vocals___algorithm-mel_vocals_bs_others___nullifySum-ai_distribute_on_drums_and_other___nuoStemsVersion-4.0.0-alpha.37.wav`

## Save Instrumental & Acapella

When enabled, instrumental (all stems except vocals) and acapella (vocals only) stems will be saved in the output folder alongside the processed stems.

This is commonly used in non-Traktor DJ software.

Metadata is migrated and "(acapella/instrumental)" is appended to the end of the title.

You can select the encoding format for instrumental and acapella:

- **MP3 @ 320 kbps** - Compressed format with high quality
- **WAV** - Uncompressed format
