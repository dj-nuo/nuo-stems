## Compression of .stem.m4a

Select the compression format for stem files:

### AAC 320 kbps (CBR) - Recommended
- Recommended for most use cases
- Provides high quality with constant bitrate
- As of Traktor Pro 4, 320 kbps CBR AAC is used by native Traktor stems

### AAC 256 kbps (VBR)
- Good quality with smaller file size
- Default in Native Instruments "Stem Creator" software

### ALAC (Lossless)
- **Not recommended**. See warnings below.
- Lossless compression, preserves original quality in 16-bit 44100Hz
- Results in larger file sizes

:::warning
ALAC encoded .stem.m4a seem to currently work only on macOS Traktor Pro (as of October 2025).
:::
:::warning
Some ALAC encoded .stem.m4a files show corruption errors in Traktor Pro 4 at the end of the track. It doesn't affect the playback and seems to not crash Traktor. But I would advice to stay away from ALAC encoding for now.

## STEMS Colors

Customize the colors used for your STEMS in Traktor and on supported controllers.

Changes apply to newly converted files only.

:::tip
Not all controllers support the full gamut of colors. If a selected color does not appear as expected, try experimenting with different values or use a preset optimized for your gear.
:::

:::info
To update colors for previously converted files, use the [Traktor Utilities "Change STEMS colors"](/docs/traktor-utilities/change-stems-colors) tool.

## Auto-start Processing When Collection Loaded

When enabled, NUO-STEMS will automatically start processing tracks in the queue as soon as the Traktor collection is successfully loaded.

:::info
Keep in mind that ["Auto-start processing" from Advanced tab](/docs/settings/advanced) in settings takes precedence over this setting.
