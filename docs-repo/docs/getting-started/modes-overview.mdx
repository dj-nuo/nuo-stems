NUO-STEMS 4 has these modes:

- [**Native Traktor Pro 4**](/docs/getting-started/native-traktor-pro-4)
    - Creates natively linked STEMS in Traktor Pro 4 collection. Works like "Generate Stems" button in Traktor Pro 4.
    - You know how you can create Stems in TP4 by right-clicking and selecting "Generate STEMS"? Once created, you then see little "link" icon next to your track. So, this is what is called "linked stems". You don't have separate Stems tracks in your collection. It's linked under the hood to your original and you have an option to load either original to the deck or Stems version. All the metadata is automatically shared between them.
    - native (.stem.mp4) linked stems are saved in whatever folder you have set for Stems in Traktor Pro 4 Preferences. Therefore, it's not saved to the "output folder" you set in NUO-STEMS 4 Settings.
- [**Legacy / Export**](/docs/getting-started/legacy-traktor)
    - Creates legacy .stem.m4a Traktor STEMS based on settings. Compatible with Traktor Pro 3 & 4. Can be used to generate STEMS for a different computer.
    - This is what NUO-STEMS 1, 2 and 3 did. Created .stem.m4a files. You needed to add them to your collection separately and they are shown as separate entries. If you wanted to keep both originals and .stem.m4a in sync - you needed to use Traktor Utilities feature in NUO-STEMS 3.
    - Saved to the "output folder" you set in NUO-STEMS 4 Settings
    - Use this mode if you have Gaming PC (with NVIDIA GPU) and want to generate STEMS for your DJ Laptop. You can then use Traktor Utilities in NUO-STEMS 4 to migrate .stem.m4a files to linked stems on your DJ Laptop. Using Traktor Utilities doesn't require license.
- [**DAW / Non-Traktor**](/docs/getting-started/daw-non-traktor)
    - Only saves individual WAV stem files or instrumental+acapella. No .stem.m4a or .stem.mp4 files are created. Perfect for DAW or non-Traktor DJ software.
