In Traktor Pro 4 native mode, STEMS are generated and linked to the original track in the collection. This provides a seamless experience where your stems appear directly in Traktor Pro 4, just like tracks generated with the built-in stem feature.

NUO-STEMS 4 saves natively linked STEMS in the folder you have set for Stems in Traktor Pro 4 Preferences.

This also means that no .stem.m4a files are saved to the "output folder" you set in NUO-STEMS 4 Settings.

If you want to save legacy .stem.m4a files, you can do so by using [Legacy Traktor mode](/docs/getting-started/legacy-traktor).

## STEMS Generated and Linked

Once the STEMS are generated and linked, you will see the algorithm next to the original track.

You will also see the linked STEMS icon in the Traktor list view next to the original track.
