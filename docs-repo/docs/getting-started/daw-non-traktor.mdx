DAW / Non-Traktor mode allows you to create stems for use in Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs) or other DJ software that isn't Traktor.

## Overview

When using DAW / Non-Traktor mode:
- Stems are saved as individual WAV files
- Optionally, you can save Instrumental & Acapella as WAV or MP3 (set in NUO-STEMS 4 Settings)
- Stems can be used in software like Ableton Live, Logic Pro, Rekordbox, Serato, etc.

:::tip
It is recommended to turn off "sum of stems = original mix" in NUO-STEMS 4 Settings when using DAW / Non-Traktor mode.

This will provide cleaner results.
