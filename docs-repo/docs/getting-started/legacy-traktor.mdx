Legacy Traktor mode creates legacy `.stem.m4a` files that **only work with Traktor Pro 4**. 

This mode is **also useful** if you have Gaming PC (with NVIDIA GPU) and want to generate STEMS for your DJ Laptop. You can then use [Traktor Utilities in NUO-STEMS 4 (on DJ laptop) to migrate .stem.m4a](/docs/traktor-utilities/migrate-stem-m4a-to-tp4) files to linked stems on your DJ Laptop Traktor collection. Using Traktor Utilities doesn't require paid license.

:::warning
It's **not recommended** to use this mode if you have Traktor Pro 4. Use [Native Traktor Pro 4 mode](/docs/getting-started/native-traktor-pro-4) instead.

The only valid use case for this mode is if you want to save space & you're ok to [only have .stem.m4a files in your collection](/docs/tips-and-workflows/only-stem-m4a-no-originals). Meaning that you don't want to have original tracks in your collection.

There is **no Traktor Utilities feature to sync metadata between originals and stems** in NUO-STEMS 4 (like in NUO-STEMS 3). This is a deliberate design decision. I want you to **support Traktor team by upgrading to Traktor Pro 4**. 

Also, .stem.m4a files created in NUO-STEMS 4 are not compatible with NUO-STEMS 3.

### Overview

<img src="/img/shared/stem-m4a-in-finder-example.webp" alt="Legacy .stem.m4a files in Finder" width="600px" />

When using Legacy Traktor mode:
- Stems are saved as `.stem.m4a` files
- Stems are saved to your configured output folder in NUO-STEMS 4 Settings
- Stems appear as separate entries in your Traktor collection
- You need to manually add stem files to your collection

### Important Notes

:::warning
There are no ["Traktor Utilities" similar to NUO-STEMS 3](/docs/v3/traktor-utilities/general/) which would allow you to transfer metadata between originals and stems. You need to treat `.stem.m4a` files as [first class citizens](/docs/tips-and-workflows/only-stem-m4a-no-originals).
:::

- Stems created in this mode are separate files that need to be added to your collection
- For Traktor Pro 4 users, I recommend using Native [Traktor Pro 4 mode](/docs/getting-started/native-traktor-pro-4) instead
