title: I have only .stem.m4a and no originals
---

If you only have `.stem.m4a` files (created in NUO-STEMS 3 or NUO-STEMS 4) in your collection and no original tracks, you have a few options:

## Option 1: Re-convert existing .stem.m4a files

You can re-convert your existing `.stem.m4a` files to NUO-STEMS 4 `.stem.m4a` files. The main benefit you'll get is improved STEMS quality thanks to the new algorithms in NUO-STEMS 4.

:::info
Upon my testing, AUDIO_ID of the new .stem.m4a (created in NUO-STEMS 4) shall be the same as previous .stem.m4a (created in NUO-STEMS 3). So you can potentially replace existing .stem.m4a files in-place. However, I would advise to check at least a few originals to make sure that everything is working correctly.

Also, it's always a good idea to backup your collection & files before doing any major changes.

NUO-STEMS 4 will also make sure to output correct filename (e.g. `song.stem.m4a` will be converted to `song.stem.m4a`).

## Option 2: Migrate to Traktor Pro 4 approach

If you want to migrate to the [Traktor Pro 4 approach](/docs/getting-started/native-traktor-pro-4) with both originals and "linked native" stems in your collection:

:::info
Currently, there is no straight-forward way to do this. But this feature is being looked into for the future. You might want to hold off from migration right now.
:::

If you still want to proceed with migration, you need to:

1. Add originals to your collection.
2. Analyze all originals in TP4 (no need to set hotcues).
3. Close Traktor Pro 4.
4. Open **NUO-STEMS 3** (not NUO-STEMS 4) and go to [Settings > Traktor Utilities](/docs/v3/traktor-utilities/general/). 
5. Change "Transfer direction" to "STEMS to Original".
6. Go to "Traktor Utilities" tab and click "Sync All".
7. Now you have both originals and "linked native" stems in your collection synced. Originals shall have correct colors, hotcues, beatgrids, etc.
    1. :::warning 
        I would advice to check at least few originals to make sure that everything is synced correctly. 
8. Delete all .stem.m4a files from your collection.
9. Prooceed with generating new ["linked native"](/docs/getting-started/native-traktor-pro-4) stems from the originals using NUO-STEMS 4.
