title: STEMS Separation Quality
---

NUO-STEMS 4 features improved STEMS separation algorithms that deliver higher quality results compared to previous versions.

Metric used is called SDR (Signal-to-Distortion Ratio) - read more about it [here](https://source-separation.github.io/tutorial/basics/evaluation.html). And benchmark run results are available [here](https://mvsep.com/quality_checker/multisong_leaderboard?algo_name_filter=NUO&sort=vocals&ranking_metrics=).

NUO-STEMS 4 comes with 2 new algorithms:
- mel_vocals_bs_others (Recommended)
    - Vocals: Processed with Mel-Band-RoFormer (that was first introduced in NUO-STEMS 3.1)
    - Drums, Bass & Other: Processed with BS-RoFormer
    - Provides amazing quality, especially for vocals
    - [Algorithm link](https://github.com/KimberleyJensen/Mel-Band-Roformer-Vocal-Model)
- bs_roformer
    - New algorithm introduced in NUO-STEMS 4
    - Provides great quality for all stems
    - Vocals quality is similar to 'mel_vocals_bs_others'
    - Feel free to experiment and compare with 'mel_vocals_bs_others' - sometimes one or another brings better results

**All the algorithms in NUO-STEMS are open source and available on GitHub (click links above).**


### Hearing comparisons
There are a lot of comparisons between different programs (Serato, Traktor Pro, RekordBox, etc.) available in [this YouTube playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRe7_kGtbFmgUT9LKCm-B_yGmQgalHS_t&si=wXz2h8UGAwP2rG5b)
