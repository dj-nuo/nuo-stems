NUO-STEMS 4 includes a demo mode that allows you to try the software before purchasing a license.

## Demo Mode Limitations

Only **20 seconds of audio** is processed starting from the middle of the track. There is no limit on the number of tracks you can process in demo mode.

:::warning
**Traktor [natively linked STEMS](/docs/getting-started/native-traktor-pro-4) are not allowed in demo mode** because linking short 20-sec audio tracks to full length originals doesn't make sense.

However, you can still use [Legacy / Export Mode](/docs/getting-started/legacy-traktor) to create .stem.m4a files or [DAW / Non-Traktor mode](/docs/getting-started/daw-non-traktor) to create .wav files for testing purposes.

## What You Can Do in Demo Mode

Basically all the features of NUO-STEMS 4 are available in demo mode, except for creating Traktor [natively linked STEMS](/docs/getting-started/native-traktor-pro-4).
- ✅ Create individual WAV stem files using [DAW / Non-Traktor mode](/docs/getting-started/daw-non-traktor)
- ✅ Create .stem.m4a files using [Legacy / Export Mode](/docs/getting-started/legacy-traktor)
- ✅ Test the quality of stem separation algorithms
- ✅ Export instrumental and acapella versions (WAV or MP3)
- ✅ Use [Traktor Utilities](/docs/traktor-utilities/overview)
