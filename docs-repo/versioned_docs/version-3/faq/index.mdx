### Conversion get's "stuck" at some %
It might happen for various reasons, but the most common one - your anti-virus (almost solely on Windows) deleted some files that NUO-STEMS installed.\
To fix it there are 2 options:

1.  Disable anti-virus & re-install NUO-STEMS
2.  Download & place necessary files manually
    1.  Download installation archive:
        1.  For example, for version 3.0.0 it is: `https://nuo-stems.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/nuo-stems-3-3.0.0-x64.nsis.7z`
        2.  If you use another version - replace `3.0.0` with the version you're using
    2.  Extract it
    3.  Place the "extraResources" folder (inside the "resources" folder) here: `C:\Users\%YOUR_USER%\AppData\Local\Programs\NUO-STEMS-3\resources\extraResources`
3.  If issue is still present:
    1.  restart NUO-STEMS
    2.  press "Start Processing"
    3.  wait for it to get "stuck" on whatever % it gets stuck for you
    4.  wait 5 more minutes
    5.  Go to "Settings" -> "Advanced" -> "Open Logs"
    6.  [Send me](https://www.facebook.com/djnuo)"main.log" file from the folder that opened

:::info Why it happens?
Windows Defender. NUO-STEMS is not "signed" on Windows because it's incredible hard to obtain "EV Certificate". You need to have a company, various checks etc. At some point I tried to do that, but failed due to being situated in Ukraine. There are no such issues on Mac OS - everything is properly signed there.
