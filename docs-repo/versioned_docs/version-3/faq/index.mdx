# FAQ

## How does some feature work in NUO-STEMS?
- See this video first that answers many questions: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndHu0_1TLiY
- Read [NUO-STEMS documentation](/)

## Conversion get's "stuck" at some %
It might happen for various reasons, but the most common one - your anti-virus (almost solely on Windows) deleted some files that NUO-STEMS installed.\
To fix it there are 2 options:

1.  Disable anti-virus & re-install NUO-STEMS
2.  Download & place necessary files manually
    1.  Download installation archive:
        1.  For example, for version 3.0.0 it is: `https://nuo-stems.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/nuo-stems-3-3.0.0-x64.nsis.7z`
        2.  If you use another version - replace `3.0.0` with the version you're using
    2.  Extract it
    3.  Place the "extraResources" folder (inside the "resources" folder) here: `C:\Users\%YOUR_USER%\AppData\Local\Programs\NUO-STEMS-3\resources\extraResources`
3.  If issue is still present:
    1.  restart NUO-STEMS
    2.  press "Start Processing"
    3.  wait for it to get "stuck" on whatever % it gets stuck for you
    4.  wait 5 more minutes
    5.  Go to "Settings" -> "Advanced" -> "Open Logs"
    6.  [Send me](https://www.facebook.com/djnuo)"main.log" file from the folder that opened

:::info Why it happens?
Windows Defender. NUO-STEMS is not "signed" on Windows because it's incredible hard to obtain "EV Certificate". You need to have a company, various checks etc. At some point I tried to do that, but failed due to being situated in Ukraine. There are no such issues on Mac OS - everything is properly signed there.

## Can NUO-STEMS replace Stem Creator by Native Instruments?
First of all, here is the fix to Stem Creator to make it work with latest versions of Mac OS:[link](https://community.native-instruments.com/discussion/2946/stem-creator-m1-monterey-export-failed/p2)

Secondly, here is the reason why "not":\
Mostly because of "compressor" & "limiter" that are present in Stem Creator. It looks like some VST magic that NI built into Stem Creator to provide real-time feedback. I'm not familiar with this technology, so your best luck remains with Stem Creator 🙂

## NUO-STEMS is "stuck" at "Checking License" or "License Check Failed"
There might be few potential causes:

1.  Your computer is not connected to the internet. NUO-STEMS requires internet connection on the startup to check the license.
2.  Your provider/system/WiFi-router blocks `https://nuo-stems.com` from being reachable.
    1.  Restart computer
    2.  **Restart WiFi router**
    3.  Launch NUO-STEMS
3.  Windows PowerShell is for some reason "broken" on your computer
    1.  Follow this guide to fix it:[link](https://support.slatedigital.com/hc/en-us/articles/20352080857363-Powershell-is-not-recognized)

If none of the above helps - try settings your DNS to Google DNS: 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4. Instructions: [link](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/using)

## I bought new computer, how do I activate/transfer my license to it?
If you want to transfer license to new computer - you need to [send me](https://www.facebook.com/djnuo):

1.  Your email that you used for purchase
2.  New computer uuid - https://nuo-stems.com/uuid

    2. And also remove: `C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\NUO-STEMS-3\`
2. On Mac OS:
    1. `/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Library/Application Support/nuo-stems-3/`

If it doesn't help:

1. Launch NUO-STEMS and let it "crash"
2. [Send me](https://www.facebook.com/djnuo) main.log file from:
    1. Windows logs location: `C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\nuo-stems-3\logs\main.log`

## Can I use my license on 2 computers?
One license is only for one computer.

If you want to transfer your license to another computer – see license transferring section above 🙂

## My collection.nml got corrupted, how do I fix it?
NUO-STEMS v3 automatically creates a backup of your collection.nml on every launch. If you have a problem with your collection.nml - try to revert it to the backup.

Backups are stored in the **"Collection Backups NUO-STEMS 3"** folder in the same folder as your collection.nml. Example for Traktor 4.1.1:
- MacOS: `/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Documents/Native Instruments/Traktor 4.1.1/Collection Backups NUO-STEMS 3`
- Windows: `C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\Documents\Native Instruments\Traktor 4.1.1\Collection Backups NUO-STEMS 3`
