# Using with DAW (.wav stems)
## Settings
If you want to use .wav stems in your DAW (e.g. Ableton, Logic, Pro Tools, etc.), you will need to enable "save .wav" in the Settings.

Once enabled, any new files will be exported as .wav stems.

:::warning
If you previously exported stems as .stem.m4a, you will need to **re-export them as .wav** stems.
